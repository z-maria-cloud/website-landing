# website-landing

The main landing page of my website.
Also contains some "static-ish" pages that didn't really need their own server.

## Currently contains these pages:

- **colorfulprojects.cloud**: the main landing page of my website. Contains links to other projects that are currently hosted.
- **About Me**: a page that lists the various programming languages, frameworks and software that I use.

To use:
- Clone this repository
- Run "npm install" to install the dependencies
- **Important**: by default runs on port 3000, you can customize the port number in package.json

Usage:
- `npm run dev`: runs the server on port 3000
- `npm run production`: runs the server on port 3000 while passing NODE_ENV=production
